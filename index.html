    <h1>🧪 LRQ-FACT: Case Study</h1>

    <h2>Real</h2>
    <p>
        In this case study, the description is well-constructed and aligns perfectly with
        the image and the textual context. The depiction of Jake Davis as a young man in casual clothing, standing in a
        relaxed manner, accurately reflects the narrative of his release from a young offender institution. The visual
        context provided in the image adds credibility to the news article, confirming the validity of the description.
        There are no discrepancies between the image and the text, making the description not only good but also a
        reliable tool to confirm the factual correctness of the news.
        <br><br>
        The questions presented in this case are well-formed and reliable. They are designed to extract key details from
        both the image and the text, ensuring comprehensive verification. The visual questions effectively ask about the
        setting and identity, which helps in confirming whether the person and location in the image match the article’s
        claims. The text-based questions aim to validate the timeline and factual details, ensuring a consistent
        narrative. These questions are precise and structured to get the best possible answers, making them a solid
        mechanism for cross-verifying facts.

    </p>

    <!-- Case 1 -->
    <div class="tcolorbox">
        <div class="tcolorbox-content">
            <img src="figure/Example1.jpg" alt="Case 1 Image"
                style="width:100%; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #aaa;">
            <p>
                This example case illustrating the alignment between image and text in a fact-checking process. The
                generated questions verify key elements, ensuring consistency and accuracy in multimodal
                misinformation detection. This demonstrates how targeted questions and well-constructed descriptions
                enhance reliable fact-checking outcomes.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h2>Textual Veracity Distortion</h2>
    <p>
        The description in the following study accurately depicts a lighthouse in a Gothic architectural style,
        positioned on a rocky shore with surrounding water and seagulls. The image is valid and corresponds with the
        article's general theme. However, the description’s alignment with the actual claim in the text—that the
        lighthouse is haunted and located in Greece—proves to be incorrect. While the description is visually consistent
        and good, it does not support the erroneous textual claim, showing how important it is to assess both text and
        visuals in tandem.
        <br><br>
        The questions in this case are reliable and appropriately structured to identify discrepancies between the image
        and the text. The visual questions ask about the architectural style and contextual clues from the image, while
        the text-based questions explore the factual accuracy of the claim that this lighthouse is haunted and located
        in Greece. The questions provide a good framework for fact-checking by encouraging thorough scrutiny of both
        visual and textual elements. This ensures that any distortions or misrepresentations in the article are
        effectively highlighted, making the questions a valuable tool for getting to the truth.
    </p>

    <!-- Case 2 -->
    <div class="tcolorbox">
        <div class="tcolorbox-content">
            <img src="figure/Example4.jpg" alt="Case 2 Image"
                style="width:100%; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #aaa;">
            <p>
                This example case illustrating textual veracity distortion. The image description aligns visually with
                the content, but fails to support the false textual claim about the haunted lighthouse's location in
                Greece. The generated questions are designed to detect inconsistencies, providing a thorough framework
                for fact-checking by scrutinizing both visual and textual elements.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h2>Visual Veracity Distortion</h2>
    <p>
        Here, the description of a clock tower in yellow and white is valid and clear, but the image itself shows a
        structure that is clearly gold and digitally altered. The description is good in terms of clarity and helping
        readers visualize the article's claim, even though it does not reflect the manipulated nature of the image. This
        highlights the importance of analyzing the veracity of visuals alongside textual descriptions.
        <br><br>
        The questions are well-crafted to reveal any visual inconsistencies. The visual questions ask about the color
        and reality of the clock tower, which are key to identifying that the clock tower has been digitally altered.
        The text-based questions, which probe the existence of such a clock tower in real life, also help uncover
        discrepancies. These questions are reliable and precise, aimed at extracting the best possible answers and
        guiding the evaluation of the article’s claims against the evidence provided by the image.
    </p>

    <!-- Case 3 -->
    <div class="tcolorbox">
        <div class="tcolorbox-content">
            <img src="figure/Example3.jpg" alt="Case 3 Image"
                style="width:100%; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #aaa;">
            <p>
                This example case highlighting visual manipulation. The description accurately conveys the textual claim
                about a yellow and white clock tower, but fails to reflect the digitally altered gold structure seen in
                the image. The questions focus on detecting visual discrepancies, such as the altered colors, and also
                probe the existence of such a clock tower, providing a reliable framework for evaluating both the image
                and text.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    <h2>Cross-modal Consistency Distortion</h2>
    <p>
        This case involves a clear mismatch between the text and the image, where the
        article describes a little girl holding uncooked rolls, while the image shows her holding paper towels. The
        description is coherent and well-explained, making it a good tool to visualize the scenario presented in the
        article. However, the inconsistency between the image and the text highlights a cross-modal distortion. Despite
        this, the description itself remains valid in its own right.
        <br><br>
        The questions presented are well-designed to highlight the inconsistency between the text and the image. The
        visual questions ask about the scene and the object the girl is holding, providing clear answers that reveal the
        mismatch. The text-based questions further confirm this by addressing the article’s lack of accurate
        description. These questions are well-structured and reliable, allowing for an in-depth examination of both the
        image and the text to expose cross-modal discrepancies. They guide the analysis toward the best possible answers
        by focusing on the key elements that need verification.
    </p>

    <!-- Case 4 -->
    <div class="tcolorbox">

            <p>
                This example case demonstrating cross-modal distortion. The description is clear and helps visualize the
                article’s scenario of a little girl holding uncooked rolls, while the image actually shows her holding
                paper towels. This mismatch between text and image points to a cross-modal distortion. The questions are
                well-crafted to reveal this inconsistency by focusing on both the scene and the object in the girl's
                hands, providing a reliable framework for identifying the discrepancy between the article and the image.

    <h2>Question Quality Assessment Prompt</h2>
    <p>
        To evaluate the relevance of generated questions, we use a fact-checking criteria-based prompt that classifies
        questions as relevant or irrelevant. This assessment considers factors such as alignment with the claim,
        specificity, and usefulness in verifying factual accuracy.

                You are an advanced AI tasked with evaluating the authenticity of a news article and its accompanying
                image. Your objective is to determine whether the provided questions <strong>[generated
                    questions]</strong> effectively assess the accuracy, credibility, and reliability of the news
                article text.

            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
                <em>Assess each question based on the following expert fact-checking criteria:</em>
            </p>
            <em>
                1. Critical Thinking and Skepticism: Does the question challenge assumptions, probe deeper into claims,
                and avoid taking information at face value?<br>
                2. Analytical Depth: Does it break down complex statements into verifiable components?<br>
                3. Systematic Approach: Does it follow a structured methodology in assessing sources, claims, and
                evidence?<br>
                4. Precision & Specificity: Is it clear, direct, and free from vague or overly broad wording?<br>
                5. Factual Accuracy: Does it focus on verifying evidence, checking primary sources, and detecting
                misinformation?<br>
                6. Logical Consistency: Does it help identify contradictions, misleading narratives, or
                inconsistencies?<br>
                7. Source Credibility & Bias Detection: Does it evaluate the reliability of cited sources and potential
                biases?<br>
                8. Context Awareness: Does it consider the broader context surrounding the claim?<br>
                9. Comparative Thinking: Does it encourage cross-referencing with established facts or alternative
                perspectives?<br>
                10. Repeatability & Objectivity: Can the question be applied consistently across different cases without
                personal bias?

            <p><strong>Rating Scale:</strong></p>
            <em>
                - <strong>Relevant</strong>: The question is precise, well-structured, and effectively assesses factual
                accuracy, credibility, and logical consistency.<br>
                - <strong>Irrelevant</strong>: The question is vague, lacks depth, or fails to critically probe the

            <p>Your objective is to determine whether the article and image are real or fake by analyzing the following
                information:</p>
            <p>
                1. News Article Text: <strong>[news text]</strong><br><br>

                <span style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #333;"><em>Note: This description helps verify consistency with
                        the news text. It is generally reliable but may contain minor discrepancies, such as using
                        different terms like “ocean” instead of “water”.</em></span><br>
