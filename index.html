                2. Analytical Depth: Does it break down complex statements into verifiable components?<br>
                3. Systematic Approach: Does it follow a structured methodology in assessing sources, claims, and
                evidence?<br>
                4. Precision & Specificity: Is it clear, direct, and free from vague or overly broad wording?<br>
                5. Factual Accuracy: Does it focus on verifying evidence, checking primary sources, and detecting
                misinformation?<br>
                6. Logical Consistency: Does it help identify contradictions, misleading narratives, or
                inconsistencies?<br>
                7. Source Credibility & Bias Detection: Does it evaluate the reliability of cited sources and potential
                biases?<br>
                8. Context Awareness: Does it consider the broader context surrounding the claim?<br>
                9. Comparative Thinking: Does it encourage cross-referencing with established facts or alternative
                perspectives?<br>
                10. Repeatability & Objectivity: Can the question be applied consistently across different cases without
